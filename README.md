## 🛠 Features

The **ida-python-bytecode** tool offers several noteworthy features:

- **Full Python Version Support**: It disassembles bytecode from Python 2.7 through 3.14+. This includes various formats to ensure compatibility with version specifics.
- **Automatic Version Detection**: The tool can detect the Python version of your bytecode files automatically.
- **Raw Marshal Support**: It can load raw marshal code objects directly, which means you do not always need a `.pyc` header.
- **Rich Disassembly Output**: Your analysis includes:
  - Resolved constant pool references (like strings and numbers)
  - Resolved variable names for easier understanding
  - Clear symbols for comparison and binary operators
  - Displayed intrinsic function names for Python 3.12 and onwards.
- **Proper Control Flow Analysis**: Understand how code flows with in-depth control flow analysis.

## 💻 System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python Support**: This tool works with Python compiled `.pyc` files from versions 2.7 to 3.14+.
- **Hardware**: A basic computer capable of running your OS should be sufficient.

## 📊 Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Launch the Application
